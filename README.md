# KAGGLECOMPETITION
My documents for the kaggle competition.

Here you can find the python code, as well as the report explaining everything.

Note that there are some code on the python program about the numpy version, and toch. That was because for some reason I ended up having big trouble with the different versions installed on my computer, but you can erase that part of the code.
